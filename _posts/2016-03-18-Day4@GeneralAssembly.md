## I have no inspiration for titles on Friday.

Last day of the first week, started with some JS warm-up exercises and homework show-and-tell. A guest speaker was on at lunchtime, [Andre](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrevidic) is an Alumni student from GA, he shared is job hunting journey and give us some tips about being successful in class :   
- Get into a daily routine other than coding, like rock climbing, meditation or painting or whatever that will free your mind from coding.
- Hackathons and Meetups are the places you want to be, for free food, learning and connecting with other human beeing.
On the Afternoon a pen and paper quiz was about to be held in the classroom, the only problem is that we had to team up, people were a little shy so we wrote a JS program that will properly create a random group from the list of students.

## :dart: Every day goals :  

**Coding**, I started working on a journey finder for Melbourne public transport, it's working if you don't go too far, and if you feel like console interaction... , I heard the future is in chatbot so I'm right into it.

**Talking about it**,  I recorded my fourth [Walk and Talk](https://soundcloud.com/johan-c-819300950/walk-and-talk-day-4-58), be kind to yourself and don't listen to that, except if you want to pick up a French accent.

## :book: TIL :

- Always start on a piece of paper, you will save yourself time and rest your eyes. Write code on paper first is a good way to see if you know where you are going.
