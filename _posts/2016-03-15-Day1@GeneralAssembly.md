@Ga_Melbourne by *Johan Codinha*.  

## First, we discuss the actual job of a Web developer.  

**Read and Write** text files, it's not as easy as it seems. First, you have to make a decision on which text editor you are going to use, not an easy task when you have three teachers, all telling you to use a different one. So I ended up downloading three and configure one. So far I'm kind of using Vim for quick text edit from the terminal and Sublime to write code and Markdown pages like this one.   
**Solving problems** by breaking them into small pieces and *debugging*, are others part of the job, maybe solving problems should come first, I'm not sure. After the discussion went a little bit philosophical, we ended up agreeing on the following quote, "If debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in."  

## :dart: Every day goals :  

**Coding**, it's what I sign-up for when I decided to change career, it's a good thing that I love doing it.  
**Talking about it**, engage conversation with other developers, it's always nice to hear them say acronyms and realize you had it [all wrong](https://twitter.com/JohanCodinha/status/710046478752989184) on the pronunciation part. I will also try on recording a daily talk (with myself) about my progress during the course, and maybe other stuff, and maybe I'll just do one. You can listen to me [Walking and Talking](https://soundcloud.com/johan-c-819300950/sets/walks-and-talks), for the first time. I have no idea what I'm doing, let's try something new.

## :book: TIL :

- How to be efficient with the **terminal.** Like anyone born before the iPad release, I had some basic on how to use it. I followed the advice and install iTerm for macOS and after setting up some aliases and symlink my life just started to make sense.  
- **How to use Git, and [GitHub :octocat:](https://github.com/JohanCodinha)**, Git was partially cover in the pre-work but since GitHub is kind of a social platform for collaboration it was great to practice with the group, by the way do not trust those green square from March 15, it's just some fork, clone, add, commits -m "with meaningful comment" and then pushed back to GitHub.
