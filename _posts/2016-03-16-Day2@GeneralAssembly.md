@Ga_Melbourne by *Johan Codinha*.  

####It was a warm and sunny day, let's dive into JavaScript.  
You may think that we are learning JS because everybody is using it, well you are not even wrong. It's *J*u*S*t *everywhere*, on your web browser of course but also on phones, vending machines, the space station and it's powering nuclear submarine too. I'm not sure about the last one but you get the point, JS interpreters/VM/engine runs on lots of different platforms, except for about ~1% of users who deactivate it,  probably to save on bandwidth, avoid ads and render the page faster, smart move guys.  
With the pre-work and others random life encounters, most of my classmates and I were already familiar with the basic of the language, until you start using strict mode and learn about things like transitivity and the others 'bad parts' of JS, because where there is [good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bo36MrBfTk4), there is also bad.

## :dart: Every day goals :  

**Coding**, we exercise on variables, arrays, data types, logical operators and type conversion, while using gitHub and trying to get the command line workflow up to expectations.  
**Talking about it**, for the second time I have recorded a [walk and talk](https://soundcloud.com/johan-c-819300950/walk-and-talk-day-2-58) with myself in Dolby digital FrenGlish. I really think this is terrible, this is why I'm going to continue doing it to improve my 'communication skills', because yes sometimes developers have to use their voices for human conversations.

## :book: TIL :  
- Not to trust JavaScript when it tells me that I don't need a semicolon.  
- **Always** use `===` and `!==` and let their evil twins == and != rest in peace page 55 of the 1999 specification.
- Other JS ~~quirks~~ features...
