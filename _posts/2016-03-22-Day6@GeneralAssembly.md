## :globe_with_meridians: Styling the wonderful World Wide Web.
When I studied electronics engineering back in high school, we spend so much time learning about old technologies just in case we had to work on old systems like the >115 years old Parisians métro or analogue A/V systems, and that's about it actually.
This is _exactly_ what we are doing in class today, well not a `===` _exactly_, more like a sloppy `==` _exactly_. CSS evolved a lot since it's last variation CSS3, plus half the features are still [working Draft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#CSS_3). If I only know how to do a grid layout with the latest functionality, I won't be able to work on code that's ~~only a year old~~ been made for some browsers. And same applies to other languages, to just about everything, I guess. So let's learn about the web of the past, so that I can ~~forget it~~, move on.

## :dart: Every day goals :  

**Coding**, today felt a lot more like scripting with CSS, but we always spend early morning time to do some JS exercises, just to warm-up the brain.
**Talking about it**, I recorded another quick chat with myself, if you really have nothing better to do then check it out, [walk and talk](https://soundcloud.com/johan-c-819300950/walk-and-talk-day-6-58).

## :book: TIL :

- **HTML**
        - [Landmark](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles#landmark_roles) tags like `<main>`, `<navigation>`, `<search>`,… should only appear **once** in the page. There role is to help users navigate to the region they describe.
        - Do not use "legacy" tags like `<b> </b>`, instead, use more semantic ones like `<em>`, another example : `<br>` should not be used anymore, use the CSS margin/padding properties instead.
- **CSS**  
        - [box-sizing:](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing) border-box; Use it ! to get your calculation right.
        - Web browser 'user agent stylesheet' will try to screw you, but by default CSS will also try to screw you.
