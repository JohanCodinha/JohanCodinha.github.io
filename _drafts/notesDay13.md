Today:
- meet ruby
- let's make a dice
- guess the number
- line count
- PTV

Today we are goind to learn new things ! 
ruby is about the same age of javascript
until about the last 10 years it wasn't know, when ruby rails arrived.
what is ruby , just a programme that run on your computer that can read a ruby files
what I like about ruby : it's pretty english, easy to read

priority of ruby, the programmer should be happy !, no guaranties 

if you want to share functionality, ruby use a package management system, 
called gems.

ruby come with repl (read execute print loop) called `irb`.

`gem install` to install new gems

they says everything in ruby is an object, well just like with js it's not true

Random.rand(1..10) #will give you a random number in the 

whats the difference between single and double quotes in ruby ? 
    - single quote will print exactly whats inside
    - dbl quotes will convert #{ variable } inside the quote so that
        puts " your name is #{ name }" will print "yout name is john"

passing argument to a ruby program with ARGV

you can write if statement the other way aroud. ex:
if (a > b){
    puts 'Hello'
}
puts 'hello' if a > b

to get random from an array in js you would have do do Math.random to get a random index, in ruby you can do the same thing by Random.rand(1..3) and then pass on the index, or you can just array.sample that will return a random element fron the array

a lots of the common stuff are in there, this is why people love ruby
