- **wonderfull world wide web**
        27 years from now, on the months of march, invention of the www by tim bert lee
- **hypertext**
- **domain name system**
- **http vs file**  
- **html**        "there is two type of tag, sandwich and toast" DT
        install emmet to sublime then "!" + tab = magic
        tags already have defaults style.
- **css selectors**
        class > p will select only p on the first level of the class, it will leave the nested one untuched.
        [Css color](http://colours.neilorangepeel.com)
        Cssdefault will try to screw you
        Css  
        - box model
        - display mode :  
                1. block
                2. inline
        - document flow
        
        use box-sizing: border-box; use it to get your calculation right
        * {
            box-sizing: border-box;
        }
        
        TO center a div : 
        div {
          width: 100%;
          margin: 0 auto;
        }
        p {
          width: 60%;
          margin:  0 auto;
        }
          

- **callbacks**
- **DOM**
        document object model, a web page is just a giant object with each tag a nestead object, represented like a tree, a DOM tree :evergreen_tree:
        What you see in the browser when you source code is actually the reprensentation of the dom by the browser
