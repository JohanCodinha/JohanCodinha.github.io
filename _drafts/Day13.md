##:gem: Monday morning 9am, let's talk about Ruby.

New week, new chapter. Let's put the front end learning on hold for a moment, we will get back to it later on. Today is all about the server side basics and an introduction to the Ruby language.
To prepare the course we had to read the first chapters of ['Eloquen Ruby'](http://www.r-5.org/files/books/computers/languages/ruby/main/Russ_Olsen-Eloquent_Ruby-EN.pdf) by Obie Fernandez. Since I spend most of my weekend working in a busy cafe, it's hard to find time to read books, but my job allows me  to watch/listen to courses while working.
So it's what I have done, this [course](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/ruby-fundamentals/table-of-contents) is about 3h30 min, but after that you will get the fundamentals of Ruby, well, at least, you will have a list of question for your teacher.

## :dart: Every day goals :  

**Coding**, some Ruby here and some JS there, the good thing about mixing up languages is that you see a different approach to solving  problems that you can then applied back to other languages.  
**Talking about it**, I'm not getting used to this [Walking and Talking](https://soundcloud.com/johan-c-819300950/walk-and-talk-day-13-58). 

## :book: TIL :

- **The history**, ruby his about the same age as javascript but only started to be used broadly since the rails framework came out in 2005.
- **The philosophy** that his creator [Yukihiro Matsumoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto) tried to implement in the language is that the programmer should be happy, no guarantees made.
- **The fundamentals** of the language, using debugging tools like REPL and pry, installing gems and the human readable syntax of the language.
