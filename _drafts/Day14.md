##:gem: The natural syntax of Ruby

Ruby follow the principle of least surpise, wich means that you shouldn't be too surpise by how things works. Of course this only applies if you are familiar with at least one other programing language. If you do, your learning curve will be minimized because you will reuse pre-existing knowledge. On top of that the syntax is pretty straightforward, let's says that you want to get the last element of an array, in Js you would need to get the size of the array and withdraw one, in Ruby you simply do array.last, and you won't be surprise that array.last return the first one.

## :dart: Every day goals :  

**Coding**, manipulation on the file system (that sounds dangerous) and Api request using the Github public api, then Github went down, so I went to bed.
**Talking about it**, ///////////////////////////////insert soundcloud
We had the chance to receive John Barton, director of engineering at 99designs. He gave us a great lunchtime talk on how the dev team is split and how they work together. Bonus, he gave us a selection of book, [Code Complete](http://www.stevemcconnell.com/cc.htm), [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer) and [Release It!](https://pragprog.com/book/mnee/release-it)

## :book: TIL :

- Hashes, is another data type of Ruby. Also called associative arrays, a hash is a dictionary-like collection of unique keys and their values. You acces the data the same way you will with an array `hashe[]`.
- Json, (or JavaScript Object Notation) is a standart used to transmit human readable text data, made of unordered attribute - values pairs. A colon separates the keys fron the values, and a comma separate the pairs.
- .each if you need to iterate thru a collection, that way you wont have to keep count of anything. And you wont be surprise by what `.each_with_index` does.
- `[-1]` As a human I expect this to give me the last element of an array, thank you Ruby for fulfilling my expectation.
