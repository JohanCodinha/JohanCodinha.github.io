#Day 2 / 56
@Ga_Melbourne by *Johan Codinha*.  

####It was a warm and sunny day, let's dive into JavaScript.  
You may think that we are learning JS because everybody is using it, well you are not even wrong. It's **J**u**S**t **everywhere**, on your browser, phone vending machine, the space station and it's powering nuclear submarine too. I'm not sure about the last one but you get the point, JS interpreters/VM/engine runs on a lots of different platforms (except about ~1% of users who deactivate it).  
So we might as well learn how to talk to JS interpreter the [proper way](http://jshint.com/about), only problem here is that devs, companies and randoms on stack-overflow have all their own point of view on this matter. With the pre-work and other random life encounters, most of the class was already familiar with the language, until you start using strict mode and learn about things like transitivity and the others 'bad parts' of JS, because where there is [good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bo36MrBfTk4), there is also bad.

####:dart: Every day goals :  

**Coding**, we exercise on variables, arrays, data types, logical operators and type conversion, while using gitHub and trying to get the command line work-flow up to expectations.  
**Talking about it**, for the second time I have recorded a [walk and talk](https://soundcloud.com/johan-c-819300950/walk-and-talk-day-2-58) with myself in Dolby digital frenGlish. I really think this is terrible, this is why I'm going to continue doing it to improve my communication skills, because yes sometimes developers have to use there voices for human conversations.

####:book: TIL :  
- Not to trust JavaScript when it tells me that I don't need semicolon;  
- **Always** use === and !== and let their evil twins == and != rest in peace page 55 of the 1999 specification.
- Other JS quirks...  

**:shell: Quote of the day :**
- "JavaScript try to help you, in a sloppy way." DT
