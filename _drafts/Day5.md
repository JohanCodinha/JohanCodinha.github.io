## :globe_with_meridians: The wonderful World Wide Web.  

March 1989, exactly 27 years ago. Mr. Tim Berners-lee, an English computer scientist, propose a solution to help others keep track of large scientific project at CERN, avoid the loss of information and ease access to it. In his [proposal](https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html), he described a decentralized system where document link to each other via [hypertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext). The first name he decided for was "Mesh", but when he started writing the code in May 1990 he decided on "World Wide Web".

## :dart: Every day goals :  

**Coding**, some JS to warm up the day but we focus on HTML and CSS for the rest of the day.  
**Talking about it**, Recorded my fifth [walk and talk](https://soundcloud.com/johan-c-819300950/walk-and-talk-day-4-58), maybe I should prepare those instead of just press record... Well, I don't actually have time for that.

## :book: TIL :

- **DOM** Document Object Model, a web page is just a giant object with each tag a nested object, represented like a tree, a DOM :evergreen_tree:
What you see in the browser when you have a look at the source code is actually the representation of the DOM by the browser, not the actual source.
- **CSS**
        - [Selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_started/Selectors)  Use `E > A` to select any E, child element of an A element. EX:  "article > p" will only select  <p\> tags that are a direct child of <article\>, leaving the nested one unchanged.  
        - [box-sizing:](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing) border-box; Use it ! to get your calculation right.  
        - Web browsersers's 'user agent stylesheet' will try to screw you, but by default CSS will also try to screw you.
