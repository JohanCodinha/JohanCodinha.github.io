##:gem: Sit back and watch Rails do the work.

So we spent the last three weeks learning back-ends technologies, Ruby and Psql with some simple frameworks to do routing with sinatra and object relational mapping with active record. Last week was deticated to our second project to put in use everything we learned so far.
Today was the begining of the seventh week, we started the day with an introduction to testing concept and test driven developement with minitest.
The afternoon was an intro to rails, our instructor started by doing a live demo of rails by building a twitter like website in only a few command line by using scafolding, amazing! Then he said that we will never use it again...

## :dart: Every day goals :  

**Coding**, some ruby warmups exercice and a lot of renaming files in a rails project, it's still coding.
**Talking about it**, {{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}

## :book: TIL :  
- Rails :
    - model view controller
    - package management / dependency
    - routes
- Rails pro tip : 
    - localhost:3000/rails/info/routes will give you all the route already set up in yout project when in dev mode.
    - you can change the port by going `rail serve -p 3001` so you can run multiple server on the same machine.
    - `require_relative 'sum'` when you want to require files in the same folder, instead of `require './sum'` not specific to rails.
