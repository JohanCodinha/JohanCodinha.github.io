#Day 3 / 56
@Ga_Melbourne by *Johan Codinha*.


####Another day, same old JavaScript.
The routine is in place, started the day with some serious public transport jam, yeaaaah 9 to 5 lifestyle... Anyway some warm up exercise and then more JS, learned about objects and what's the difference between them and arrays. ALso went back to functions, and the best practice to declare and use them, "I know I said function where gonna be easy, I lied"...
Afternoon guest speaker, Josh, was a WDI student for the past 3 months and came to show us his portfolio and give us some tips on how to be successful in the course and answered everyone questions.
Then I spend the night watching some video about JS, very interesting even if I don't get most of it.

####:dart: Every day goals :  

**Coding**, all day but nothing meaningful to show up I'm afraid, next time !

**Talking about it**, if you feel like listening to some stranger walking under the rain and talking with a bad accent, then go ahead : [walk and talk](https://soundcloud.com/johan-c-819300950/walk-and-talk-day-2-59).

####:book: TIL :  
- Not to over engineered the exercises, because it's a wast of time.
- Function Declarations vs. Function Expressions. Here's a nice [article](Function Declarations vs. Function Expressions) about it.

**:shell: Quote of the day :**
- "Coding is for human to read, mostly yourself, be kind to yourself." DT
- "...it's not JS best feature, in fact JS doesn't have lots off good feature." DT
- "Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." Antoine de Saint-Exupery
- "I'm sure you're good at DL things; No why ?; because you're French." Fellow student
