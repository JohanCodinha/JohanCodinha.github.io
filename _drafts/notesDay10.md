note day 11
 
 today i failed to deliver the first project, why ?
 I should have planned the devloppement with specified goal, that way I would have had a working game with front end, and a work in progress ai, wich sound better than a game with command line input and a wip ai.
I have been disctracted from the path, I wanted to learn more about ai and tried to implement the algo in js.
 lesson learn, never again.
