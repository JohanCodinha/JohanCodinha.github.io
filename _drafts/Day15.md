##:gem: Return of the web.

We spend the past two days making console based Ruby programme, lot's of fun. Today we learned how to use the micro framework [sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com), it's used to quickly create web applications in Ruby. Sinatra will take care of routing, so you can have pretty URL on your app. Templating, so you don't have to include a footer on every page. And probably a lot more that I haven't yet check out. It's a lot of new things to learn but my experience writing this blog with Jekyll already taught me most of them, so I had some extra time to work on the evening event.
After class, I went to the second round of the BudgetHack hackathon for the Victorian government. Since the rest of my team didn't make it, I was on my own to present. Once again I recommend to anyone, even beginner, to join meetups and hackathons. You will meet peoples, learn from them and make connections, plus some :pizza: if you're lucky.

## :dart: Every day goals :  

**Coding**,  and re-starting sinatra server, again and again.
**Talking about it**, thanks to the human-friendly weather being back on Melbourne, I'm out in the park to [Walk and Talk](https://soundcloud.com/johan-c-819300950/walk-and-talk-day-15-58).

## :book: TIL :  
**Sinatra : **
    - *Routing*, how to simply specified what code to execute when a certain URL is called.
    - *Templating*, how to insert a block of code to another page, so the HTML gets lighter and easier to maintain.
    - *Params and form*, how to access data in the Url to handle forms by using the params hash.  
**Pro tips : **
    - If you don't want to Dl the documentation of every new gems you install, create a .gemrc file in your home folder and add this line : `gem: --no-ri --no-rodc`.
