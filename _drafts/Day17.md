##:gem: Day out Friday.

Friday was a pretty slow day programing wise, in the morning we had an introduction to personal branding by our outcome producer. He's in charge of training us on how to get a job after the course by helping out on resumé, linkedin, personal sales pitch and all that jazz.
On the afternoon we went even less productive with the visit of a real estate compagny, they got a website and some apps so I guess it's related, I give them a point for the cake at the end of the visit.

## :dart: Every day goals :  

**Coding**, We actualy build a sinatra app to search live stock price from the yahoo api.
**Talking about it**, 

## :book: TIL :  
 - Time is precious
 - Selling houses is as boring as playing monopoly
  
**:shell: Quotes of the day :**
