## :globe_with_meridians: First day of class.
Every day, inside and outside the classroom, I learn new tools to interact with HTML CSS and JS, aka *the three amigos* , they help me build websites and webApps, seriously what's the difference ? But because it's such a vast and constantly evolving subject it's impossible to cover everything in details while in the classroom. This is why I traded fantasy and novel books for specification and documentation .pdf, well not entirely otherwise I will just turn crazy but my point is that you should not be afraid of diving into [documentations](https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign), sometimes you will even find it entertaining, or depressing it's quite subjective I guess. 
A different subject, tonight was the first [#BudgetHack](http://www.codeforaustralia.org/events/budgethack), organized by [codeForAustralia.org](http://www.codeforaustralia.org), the goal of this hackathon is to make the Victorian 2015 budget, visually attractive for everyone. Tell stories from money flow and government data, well, at least, make a prototype. I teamed up with a back-end dev, a data analyst and two non-technical folks, we will try to visualize the investment made into schools and the effect they have on the communities living around them. I really recommend everyone to join those kinds of event, I meet great peoples, converse and share some pizza with them. Second event, April 6.

## :dart: Every day goals :  

**Coding**, DOM Api everywhere, so much fun.
**Talking about it**, Another day another talk, this on is more an audio memo that helped me remember the day so that I could write this post, anyway here my seventh [Walk and Talk](https://soundcloud.com/johan-c-819300950/walk-and-talk-day-7-58).

## :book: TIL :
- **Events** ~~of my life~~, are the interface that handle hardware inputs from devices such as a mouse, keyboard, touchscreen ect... Once you detected an input, you can work with the event object.  
- **FUNctions** are just values, we can pass them as function arguments.
