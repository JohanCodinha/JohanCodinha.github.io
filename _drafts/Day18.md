##:gem: Monday morning, database 101.

Last week we have been introduced to back-ends technologies, I discovered Ruby, got a revision on OOP and played around with API. We looked at the different way to store data, mainly HTML local storage and editing text files. But because storing data into text files wasn't going anywhere, we learned how to use a real database, Postgres, and the SQL language to interact with it.


## :dart: Every day goals :  

**Coding**, a multi pages sinatra app that will search and display movies by using the imdb.com API. Not polished, no css, check it out on [github](https://github.com/JohanCodinha/IMDB).
**Talking about it**, Once again, thanks to Melbourne weather, I recorded today's [Walk and Talk](https://soundcloud.com/johan-c-819300950/walk-and-talk-day-18-58) in a garage...

## :book: TIL :  
 - **SQL** :
    - SELECT to get something from the db
    - UPDATE to modify existing entries
    - DELETE to ...
- **Sinatra** Pro tips : 
    - generate an app with `sinatra new myApp -va` -v for views, it will generate the view folder and create index.erb and layout.erb. -a for asset, this one generates public, javascript and stylsheet folders.
