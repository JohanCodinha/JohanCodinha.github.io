Tuesday Day 6
    - CSS recap - box model
        **collapsing margin** : if two margin goes in the same direction, only the bigger one will take effect, the other one will colapse.
        **percentage %** will deal with parents.

    - column layouts
    - css positioning ~/work/iterm8s/02_web/positioning
    
        - to get <ul> element side by side, display: inline-block;
        - inline element doesn't take width, they take the all wifth of the page.
        - Use relative to controle where you want to offset a relative
    - DOM API into
    - input box & buttons


html 5 markup like <main> <nav> <footer> ect... should only be present once opn the page

Do not use "legacy" stuff like <b></b>, use more semantic (mpre meaningful ) like <em>, another example : <br>, use margin/padding.

emmet nav>ul>li*3 + TAB = MAGIC
