<h2 id="another-day-same-old-javascript">Another day, same old JavaScript.</h2>
<p>The routine is in place, started the day with some serious public transport jam, 9-5 lifestyle… Anyway, some warm-up exercise and then more JS, learned about objects and what’s the difference between them and arrays. Also went back to functions, and the best practice to declare and use them, “I know I said function where gonna be easy, I lied”…
The Afternoon started with a guest speaker, Josh was a former WDI student, he showed us some of his work and gave us some tips on how to be successful in the course, cheers mate.
Then I spend the night watching some video about JS, very interesting even if I don’t get most of it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Not to over engineered the exercises, because it’s a waste of time.</li>
  <li>Function Declarations vs. Expressions. Here’s a nice <a href="https://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/07/06/function-declarations-vs-function-expressions">article</a> about it.</li>
</ul>
