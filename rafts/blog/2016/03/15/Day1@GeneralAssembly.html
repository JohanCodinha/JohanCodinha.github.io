<h4 id="today-we-discuss-what-is-the-actual-job-of-a-web-developer-">Today we discuss, what is the <strong>actual job</strong> of a <strong>Web developer ?</strong></h4>

<p><strong>Read and Write text files</strong>, it’s not as easy as it seems. First, you have to make a decision on which text editor your going to use, not an easy task when you have three teachers, all telling you to use a different one. So I ended up downloading three and configure one. So far I’m kind of using Vim for quick text edit from the terminal and Sublime to write code and Markdown pages like this one.<br />
<strong>Solving problems</strong> aka debugging, is the other part of the job, after the discusion went a little bt philisofic agreeing on this quote : “If debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in.”</p>

<h4 id="dart-every-day-goals-">:dart: Every day goals :</h4>

<p><strong>Coding</strong>, which is what I sign-up for when i decided to change career, good think that I love doing it.<br />
<strong>Talking about it</strong>, engage conversation with other developers, it’s always nice to hear them say acronyms and realize you had it <a href="https://twitter.com/JohanCodinha/status/710046478752989184">all wrong</a> on the pronunciation part. I will also try on recording a daily talk (with myself) about my progress during the course, and maybe other stuffs, and maybe I’ll just do one, you can listen to me <a href="https://soundcloud.com/johan-c-819300950/sets/walks-and-talks">Walking and Talking</a>, for the first time on soundCloud, I have know idea what I’m doing, let’s try.</p>

<h4 id="book-til-">:book: TIL :</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>How to use the terminal</strong>, this part, I already knew about it, then I realize I didn’t knew much about it, so we practice and then I started to customize my terminal and setup few aliases here and there to “optimize” the work flow.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>How to use Git, and <a href="https://github.com/JohanCodinha">GitHub :octocat:</a></strong>, the first one was already cover in the pre-work and since GitHub is kind of a social platform design for collaboration it was great to practice with the group, by the way do not trust those green square from March 15, it’s just some fork, clone, add, commits -m “w/ meaningful comment” and them pushed to GitHub.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

- “Why use git ? because everybody uses it.” DT</p>
